In this repository you will find all the resources needed to transform or create an Alexa Skill as an NodeJS Express app ready to run on Kubernetes.
These are the two possible options you can use for running your Alexa Skill on kubernetes:

**1. Using Mongo Atlas Cloud Schema**

**2. Using Provided Mongo Schema**

Those multiple options are supported by this implementation.

These are the main folders of the project:

```bash
    ├───.vscode
    ├───alexa-skill
    ├───app
    ├───docker
    ├───helm
    └───terraform
        ├───eks
        ├───aks
        └───gke
```

* **.vscode:** launch preferences to run locally your Skill for local testing.
* **alexa-skill:** this folder contains all the metadata of the Alexa Skill such as the interaction model, assets, Skill manifest, etc. In this folder you will be able to run all the `ask cli` commands.
* **app:** the backend of the Alexa Skill a NodeJS app using Express.
* **docker:** where you can find the Dockerfile of the Alexa Skill backend as a NodeJS app.
* **helm:** the helm chart of the Alexa Skill ready to be deployed on any Kubernetes Cluster.
* **terraform:** Terraform files per different kind of private clouds.
  * **eks:** All the files needed to deploy an Alexa Skill and a Kubernetes Cluster on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service.
  * **aks:** All the files needed to deploy an Alexa Skill and a Kubernetes Cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service.
  * **gke:** All the files needed to deploy an Alexa Skill and a Kubernetes Cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine.
